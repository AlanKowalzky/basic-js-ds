Diagrams folder

This folder contains simple Mermaid diagrams illustrating data structures implemented in this repository.

Files:
- bst.mmd - small binary search tree example
- queue.mmd - linked-list based queue (head -> tail)
- stack.mmd - array-based stack (bottom -> top)
- linked-list-remove.mmd - example before/after for remove-from-list

To render these diagrams you can use any Mermaid-capable viewer or VS Code extension (e.g. 'Markdown Preview Mermaid Support' or 'Mermaid Preview').
